# "New Compiler Config" SBT Plugin #

The idea here is to create a new "thing" that extends the compile.

## plugin/ ##

The `plugin/` directory contains the SBT plugin.  Go there and read the
README.md file.

## use/ ##

The `use/` directory contains the example usage.  Go there and read the
README.md file.
